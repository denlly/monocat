  <h3 id="what-is-nightwatch-">What is Nightwatch?</h3>
  <p>Nightwatch.js is an automated testing framework for web applications and websites, written in
    <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and using the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">W3C WebDriver API</a> (formerly
    <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol">Selenium WebDriver</a>).</p>
  <p>It is a complete browser (
    <em>End-to-End</em>) testing solution which aims to simplify the process of setting up
    <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> and writing automated tests. Nightwatch can also be used for writing Node.js unit tests.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Nightwatch got its name from the famous painting
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch">The Night Watch</a> by Dutch artist
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn">Rembrandt van Rijn</a>. The masterpiece is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam - The Netherlands.</p>

  <h3 id="overview-of-webdriver">Overview of WebDriver</h3>
  <p>WebDriver is a general purpose library for automating web browsers. It was started as part of the
    <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium</a> project, which is a very popular and comprehensive set of tools for browser automation, initially written
    for Java but now with support for most programming languages.</p>
  <p>Nightwatch uses the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver">WebDriver API</a> to perform the browser automation related tasks, like opening windows and clicking links for instance.</p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver">WebDriver</a> is now a W3C specification, which aims to standardize browser automation. WebDriver is a remote control
    interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform and a restful HTTP api as a way
    for web browsers to be remotely controlled.</p>

  <h3 id="theory-of-operation">Theory of Operation</h3>
  <p>Nightwatch works by communicating over a restful HTTP api with a WebDriver server (typically the Selenium server). The
    restful API protocol is defined by the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">W3C WebDriver API</a>. See below for an example workflow for browser initialization.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Most of the times, Nightwatch needs to send at least 2 requests to the WebDriver server in order to perform a command or
    assertion, the first one being the request to locate an element given a CSS selector (or Xpath expression) and the next
    to perform the actual command/assertion on the given element.</p>
